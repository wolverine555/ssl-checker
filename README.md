# ssl-checker

This a SSL Certificate checker that finds the current SSL status and the SSL certificate.

The purpose of this application is to test my knowledge and use various resources to create an application that 
has a back-end and a front end to be able to get a domain name from the user input, use that domain name to check
it's SSL certificate and from there to get more details about it, like it's issuer, date of origin, date of expiry.
